# Nintendo Switch port

This is a from-scratch port.
This port uses NXVK and thus doesn't perform well.
A deko3D backend is in the works that should provide a 2x+ performance gain

Special thanks to HayatoG. His port really helped with some implementation.

Hopefully in the future I can get this to a more native state that doesn't rely overly on compatibility stubs that can be PR'd

Features:
 - Consistent 30fps in handheld/docked.
 - Seperate handheld/docked resolution, 720p handheld, 1080p docked
 - Mod support (in future)
 - Support for SaltyNX/ReverseNX-RT.

# Overview

Dusklight is a reverse-engineered reimplementation of Twilight Princess.

It aims to be as accurate as possible to the original while also providing new options, enhancements, and tools to customize your experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Dusklight's official website is https://twilitrealm.dev/, any other website is not affiliated and may be promoting AI-generated misinformation.

# Setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Dusklight does *not* provide any copyrighted assets. You must provide your own copy of the original game.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> At a minimum, Dusklight requires a GPU with support for D3D12, Vulkan 1.1+, or Metal. For older devices, best-effort support is provided for D3D11 and OpenGL ES (Android), but will not achieve full accuracy or performance. Your experience with specific hardware, operating systems, and drivers may vary.

### 1. Dump your game

You must dump your own copy of the game. Please see [this article](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Ripping_Games) for instructions. After dumping, you can use a program like [Dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org/) or [nodtool](https://github.com/encounter/nod/releases) to convert the `.iso` to `.rvz` to save space.

Dusklight currently supports all commercial discs except for Wii's Korean release.

> [!NOTE]
> Dusklight is based on the [Twilight Princess decompilation](https://github.com/zeldaret/tp), which is currently only matching for GameCube. As a result, even when playing Dusklight with a Wii disc, you will be presented with the GameCube version's HUD and certain other specificities.

### 2. Install Dusklight

Visit the [official installation guide](https://twilitrealm.dev/install/) for full instructions.

# Building

If you'd like to build Dusklight from source, please read the [build instructions](docs/building.md).

Pull requests are welcomed! Note that we do not accept contributions that are primarily AI-generated and will close your PR if we suspect as much. Please also see the [code conventions](docs/code-conventions.md).
